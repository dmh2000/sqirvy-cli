# Review of `pkg/sqirvy/llama.go`

This document reviews the implementation of the Llama client in the sqirvy CLI tool, identifying potential bugs and areas for improvement.

## Overview

The `llama.go` file implements a client for Meta's Llama models using the langchaingo library with an OpenAI-compatible interface. It provides functionality for making text queries to Llama models with configurable parameters.

## Issues and Implementation Status

### 1. ✅ Package Documentation Inconsistency (FIXED)

**Issue:** The file started with a package comment referring to "Package api" but the actual package name is "sqirvy".

**Resolution:** The package comment has been updated to be consistent with the actual package name:

```go
// Package sqirvy provides integration with Meta's Llama models via langchaingo.
package sqirvy
```

### 2. ✅ Error Handling in QueryText Method (FIXED)

**Issue:** The `QueryText` method directly accessed `modelToMaxTokens[model]` without checking if the model exists in the map. This could cause issues if an invalid model is provided.

**Resolution:** The code now uses the `GetMaxTokens` function to safely retrieve max tokens:

```go
options.MaxTokens = GetMaxTokens(model)
```

### 3. Limited Timeout Handling

**Issue:** The client doesn't implement explicit timeout handling beyond what's provided by the context.

**Status:** Documentation has been added to clarify that request timeouts are handled by the input context, but no explicit timeout handling has been implemented:

```go
// Request timeouts are handled by the input context
```

### 4. ✅ Lack of Model Validation (FIXED)

**Issue:** The client accepts any model string without validating if it's a supported Llama model.

**Resolution:** Model validation has been added to prevent invalid API requests:

```go
provider, err := GetProviderName(model)
if err != nil || provider != Llama {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid or unsupported Llama model: %s", model)
}
```

### 5. ✅ Error Handling for API Key (FIXED)

**Issue:** While the code checks if the API key environment variable is set, it doesn't validate that the key is in the correct format or test its validity.

**Resolution:** More robust API key validation has been added:

```go
apiKey := os.Getenv("LLAMA_API_KEY")
if apiKey == "" {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("LLAMA_API_KEY environment variable not set")
}
if len(apiKey) < 8 { // Assuming a minimum length for API keys
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid LLAMA_API_KEY: key appears to be too short")
}
```

### 6. ✅ Incomplete Documentation (FIXED)

**Issue:** While there are some comments, the documentation could be more comprehensive, especially for error scenarios and parameter expectations.

**Resolution:** The documentation has been expanded for all main functions, including purpose, parameters, and error scenarios:

```go
// NewLlamaClient creates a new instance of LlamaClient using an OpenAI-compatible interface.
// It returns an error if the required LLAMA_API_KEY or LLAMA_BASE_URL environment variables are not set.
//
// The API key is retrieved from the LLAMA_API_KEY environment variable and
// the base URL is retrieved from the LLAMA_BASE_URL environment variable.
// Ensure these variables are set before calling this function.
```

### 7. ✅ Method Documentation Style Issue (FIXED)

**Issue:** The `QueryText` method's documentation included the type name (`LlamaClient.QueryText`), which is redundant in Go's documentation style.

**Resolution:** The documentation now follows Go's standard style for methods:

```go
// QueryText implements the Client interface method for querying Llama models.
// It sends a text query to Meta's Llama models and returns the generated text response.
// Request timeouts are handled by the input context.
```

### 8. Missing Whitespace in Comment

**Issue:** The comment for the temperature scale field is missing a space after the `//`:

```go
temperatureScale: 1.0, // Default temperature scale for Llama
```

**Recommendation:** Add a space after `//` for consistency with other comments:

```go
temperatureScale: 1.0, // Default temperature scale for Llama
```

### 9. Hardcoded Temperature Scale

**Issue:** The temperature scale is hardcoded to 1.0, unlike other clients which may use different scaling factors.

**Recommendation:** Make the temperature scale configurable or consistent with other providers. Consider referencing a global constant for consistency.

### 10. Fixed Context in Constructor

**Issue:** The constructor doesn't accept a context parameter, which means it can't respect timeouts or cancellation during initialization.

**Recommendation:** Consider accepting a context parameter in the constructor:

```go
func NewLlamaClient(ctx context.Context) (*LlamaClient, error) {
    // ...
    // Use ctx for any operations that might benefit from timeout/cancellation
}
```

## Implementation Summary

The updated implementation has significantly improved and addresses several of the critical issues identified in the review:

- **6 recommendations completely implemented** (✅): Package documentation inconsistency, error handling in QueryText method, model validation, API key validation, incomplete documentation, and method documentation style issue.

- **1 recommendation partially documented** (⚠️): Limited timeout handling has been documented but no explicit implementation has been added.

- **3 recommendations not yet implemented** (❌): Missing whitespace in comment, hardcoded temperature scale, and fixed context in constructor.

### Potential Next Steps

1. Add appropriate spacing after comment slashes for consistency
2. Make temperature scale configurable rather than hardcoded
3. Modify the constructor to accept a context parameter for timeout handling

Overall, the implementation is now more robust, with better error handling, validation, and documentation, making it more resilient and maintainable.
