# Code Review for sqirvy-cli

## Bugs

fixed comment 1. **models.go (line 52)**: Comment in init function incorrectly references setting usage function on `codeCmd` instead of `modelsCmd`.
   ```go
   // Note: The original code set the usage func on codeCmd here, which was likely a mistake.
   ```

fixed, returned nil 2. **prompts.go (line 68-76)**: The error handling in `ReadPrompt()` returns `[]string{""}` instead of either an empty slice or nil, which is not idiomatic Go.

Fixed, removed comment 3. **prompts.go (lines 57-60)**: Missing initialization with system prompt size check at the beginning of `ReadPrompt()` function despite comments suggesting it should be there.

N/A 4. **root.go (line 28-44)**: The root command's Run function redirects to the query command by prepending "query" to args, but doesn't properly handle flags. This could cause issues when flags are defined before positional arguments.

N/A 5. **execute.go (line 51)**: The `sqirvy.GetModelAlias()` function is called but there's no error handling for invalid aliases.

## Security

fixed 1. **prompts.go (line 92-103)**: Limited validation for URL arguments. While it checks if the URL is valid, it doesn't validate against potential security issues like SSRF attacks.

fixed 2. **Missing across files**: No sanitization of file contents or URL contents before passing to LLM, which could lead to prompt injection vulnerabilities.

N/A 3. **Missing across files**: No API key handling or credential management visible in the codebase. API keys for LLM services may be exposed or insecurely stored.

N/A 4. **prompts.go (line 104-112)**: When reading files, there's no check for file permissions or path traversal vulnerabilities.

5. **execute.go**: No rate limiting implementation to prevent abuse of API endpoints.

## Performance

1. **prompts.go (line 63-134)**: The `ReadPrompt()` function reads all content from stdin, URLs, and files before checking the total size limit, which could lead to unnecessary I/O operations for inputs that will ultimately be rejected.

2. **Missing across files**: No caching mechanism for frequently used prompts or responses to reduce API calls and improve response times.

3. **Missing across files**: No parallel processing of multiple inputs (files/URLs) to improve performance with large datasets.

4. **root.go (line 28-44)**: The redirection from root command to query command causes unnecessary command execution overhead.

5. **execute.go (line 61)**: Creates and closes client for every query rather than reusing connections, which is inefficient for multiple queries.

## Style and Idiomatic Code

1. **All files**: Inconsistent copyright notices. Some files contain empty placeholder copyright information `Copyright Â© 2025 David Howard  dmh2000@gmail.com`.

2. **prompts.go (line 48-55)**: Variable naming is not entirely consistent. Some variables use camelCase (e.g., `stdinData`) while others use snake_case in embedded comments.

3. **All files**: Some redundant comments that merely restate what the code does rather than explaining why.

4. **types.go (line 4-8)**: The `MaxInputTotalBytes` constant is hardcoded without explanation for the specific value chosen (256 KiB).

5. **root.go (line 79-84)**: Viper configuration paths could be made more configurable rather than hardcoded.

6. **root.go (line 16-17)**: Default values like `defaultPrompt` and `defaultModel` should ideally be defined in a constants section.

7. **execute.go (line 35-80)**: The `executeQuery` function is quite long and could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused functions.

8. **Missing across files**: Lack of extensive unit tests visible in the provided codebase.

9. **prompts.go (line 92-135)**: Error messages are inconsistent. Some include a prefix "error:" while others don't.

10. **root.go (line 24-25)**: The Long description text contains inconsistent spacing and indentation.

## Recommendations

1. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Correct the comment in `models.go` about which command's usage function is being set
   - Fix the error handling in `ReadPrompt()` to return nil or empty slice consistently
   - Implement the missing system prompt size check in `ReadPrompt()`
   - Rewrite the root command's Run function to properly handle flags

2. **Security Improvements**:
   - Implement proper URL validation and sanitization to prevent SSRF attacks
   - Add content sanitization before passing to LLMs to prevent prompt injection
   - Develop a secure credential management system for API keys
   - Add path traversal protection for file operations
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse

3. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Refactor `ReadPrompt()` to check size incrementally as content is read
   - Implement a caching layer for frequently used prompts and responses
   - Add parallel processing for multiple input files/URLs
   - Reuse client connections for multiple queries
   - Consider streaming responses for large outputs

4. **Style and Idiomatic Code**:
   - Standardize copyright notices across all files
   - Adopt consistent naming conventions (preferably camelCase for Go)
   - Remove redundant comments and focus on explaining "why" not "what"
   - Extract hardcoded constants to a configuration file
   - Break down large functions into smaller, more focused ones
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Standardize error message formatting
   - Fix indentation and spacing in documentation strings

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Add support for configuration profiles
   - Improve help documentation with examples
   - Add validation for model compatibility with providers
   - Implement interactive mode for better usability

## Summary

The `sqirvy-cli` tool is a well-structured CLI application that provides a convenient interface to interact with various LLM providers. It effectively uses the Cobra framework for command-line parsing and Viper for configuration management.

However, the codebase has several areas for improvement. There are minor bugs, primarily related to error handling and command execution. Security concerns include lack of input validation and secure credential management. Performance could be enhanced with caching and parallel processing. Style issues include inconsistent conventions and some non-idiomatic Go patterns.

Most critically, the error handling and security aspects should be addressed first, as they present the highest risk. The performance improvements would enhance user experience, especially when processing multiple or large inputs.

Overall, with these improvements, `sqirvy-cli` would be a more robust, secure, and performant tool for interacting with LLMs from the command line.
